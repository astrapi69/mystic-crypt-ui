"""Refuses a pull request that would close an issue it does not name on a closing line of its own
(#555).

GitHub reads "fixed: #535" as a closing keyword whatever stands before it, so "KNOWN AND NOT FIXED:
#535" in a release pull request closed #535 on the merge (8.8), and #518 the same way at 8.7. This
check lets a pull request close an issue only when a line of the body or of a commit message says
so and nothing else: "Closes #NN", "Fixes #NN", "Resolves #NN" (any form and case of the three
words), alone or followed by more references.

The references checked are the union of two sources, so that the check cannot pass on a list
GitHub has not filled yet (it fills closingIssuesReferences a few seconds after a pull request is
opened, measured on #557): the references GitHub reports, and every keyword followed by a reference
that this script finds itself in the body and the commit messages.

Input, as JSON on standard input:
  {"repository": "owner/name", "body": "...", "commits": ["message", ...],
   "closing": ["owner/name#12", ...]}
Exit 0 when every reference is named on a closing line, 1 when one is not, 2 on input it cannot
read - a check that cannot read its input does not pass (fail closed).
