"""The release freeze as a status of every open pull request into develop (#516).

While a pull request from a release/* branch is open, nothing else merges into develop until the
release is tagged (vibe-coding.md, "Release freeze"). A rule in prose was kept by memory; this
script decides the status the workflow sets on each pull request's head commit, and develop's
branch protection requires it, so GitHub refuses the merge in the browser, through auto-merge and
through scripts/merge-pr.sh alike.

Two exceptions: the release pull request itself, and a pull request labelled release-content, for
a change that is part of the release (astrapi69/lethenon#160).

Input, as JSON on standard input, the open pull requests into develop:
  {"pulls": [{"number": 12, "head_ref": "release/8.9", "head_sha": "...",
              "labels": ["release-content"]}, ...]}
Output, one line per pull request, tab separated: head_sha, state (success or failure), number,
description. Exit 0, or 2 on input it cannot read - then no status is set, and a required status
that is never set blocks the merge (fail closed).
